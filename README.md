# Hi

Pronouns: He/Him

I have way too many projects I switch between to list here but my currently most pursued is a fun little password manager.

## What I use

### OS
For operating system i use Arch Linux with i3 and Polybar. I also use Oh-My-Zsh instead of bash. My Dotfiles are available probably somewhere, i still haven't set up the repo yet lmao.

### IDE
Currently I use VSCode, with the [FiraCode Font](github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), Monokai Color theme, and Material Icons. I also ocassionally pull out Vim in the command line. I hope to get better with Vim and potentially even switch over to it fully.

### Languages
My most used Languages are

- Rust
- TypeScript
- Python

As for JS/TS i personally use Svelte allot, which i believe is much better than React or Vue. I am interested in seeing how the Yew project works out, which exclusively uses Rust/WASM.
