# Hi

Pronouns: He/Him

I have way too many projects I switch between to list here but my most pursued is a 2d game i'm making with some friends

## What I use

Currently I use VSCode, with the [FiraCode Font](github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), as well as a peaceful few hundread extentions. I also ocassionally pull out Vim in the command line. I hope to get better with Vim and potentially even switch over to it fully.

My most used Languages are

- Rust
- Python
- Javascript

## why

I have no clue what I want to program in the real world, so I might as well program everything now. Maybe MIT wont reject me.
