# Hi

I have way too many projects I switch between to list here but my most pursued is a 2d game i'm making with some friends, being built in the [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevyengine.org/)

## What I use

Currently I use VSCode, with the [FiraCode Font](github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), as well as a peaceful few hundread extentions. I also ocassionally pull out Vim in the command line. I hope to get better with Vim and potentially even switch over to it fully.

My most used Languages are

- Rust
- Python
- HTML, CSS, JS

## why

I have no clue what I want to program in the real world, so I might as well program everything now. Hopefully MIT doesn't reject me though.
